# SkipTo Page Script, Version 5.7

See the [documentation](https://skipto-landmarks-headings.github.io/page-script-5/) for more information on SkipTo.

## Building Code

The SkipTo.js code is open-source. You may feel slightly adventurous and decide to change some colors by creating a built-in color theme or even enhance the script with your changes. Once you do this, here is how you compile the skipTo script for production.

```
git clone https://github.com/skipto-landmarks-headings/page-script-5.git
cd page-script-5
sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
npm install
gulp
```

You should now have a directory called `docs/dist` with the necessary files in it.

See [Using Skipto](https://skipto-landmarks-headings.github.io/page-script-5/using.html) and the [Configuration](https://skipto-landmarks-headings.github.io/page-script-5/config.html) pages to get the SkipTo script running on your web site.
